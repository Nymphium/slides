  abstract = {This paper is concerned with certain expressions which have values
              or which describe things, which will be called 'applicative
              expressions' (or AEs). This paper is divided into two parts: the
              first part describes one method of evaluating AEs; the second part
              describes AEs which are equivalent to regular expressions and
              Backus Normal Form expressions, and interprets these expressions in
              several different ways. They are interpreted as languages,
              recognizers for membership of a language, programs, state diagrams
              and sequential circuits.Applicative expressions are structured
              objects and should be distinguished from languages. Their
              operator-operand structure is always represented in the same way
              and is independent of the operator and operand.},
